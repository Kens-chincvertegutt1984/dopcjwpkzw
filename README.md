Wow. Just, uh... wow. I didn’t even think  s could be like this anymore. Ad Vitam, man. My head. It's like someone just fed my brain through a blender and served it with a side of existential dread. You know when you leave the theater and it's like stepping out of a time machine — like yes it was dark two hours ago, but the world was at least battable, graspable. Now it's just... whoa. 

There are these scenes... with the pulsing lights, they get in your eyes like mosquito bites, but deeper? Yeah, deeper. Like they pierce through your retina and mess up your insides. Remember that scene where they're all in the water tanks? Futuristic fishbowls, maybe? Made me think of my old aquarium, except these fish are eternal. Where's the green screen line between real and CGI fish? Maybe that's the point?

> Anyway, immortality, right? A theme older than my grandma's rolled-up rug in the attic. But new somehow? Like putting olive oil on ice cream. Didn't see that coming. Spectacularly confusing. Pretty sure the couple behind me spilled popcorn at the shot when the lead, Leo, defies like... gravity? Or death? Or common sense, you decide. Reality, ha! I could hear them whisper about how to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   tonight, like catching lightning in a glass jar — good luck with that!

Oh, and the soundscape. It's like a cat purring right next to your eardrum, making the neurons tremble. The faint whoosh-whoosh of my godforsaken theater chair didn’t do it justice — my back still regrets choosing front row seats.

You remember those mind-bending lectures in college? Like an entire semester's worth flung at you through a single frame. This was that, but with more neon. Less grading, though. And more... what’s the word? Vertigo? Like getting dizzy on thoughts instead of heights.

That climactic bit by the seashore, pelicans swooping by unnoticed. Isn't life sometimes like wet sand? Grains slipping just when you think you've got a fistful. Oh, by the way, remember to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   when it’s out. It's a must-see, even with the odd chair pops and usher shuffles — worth every jolt of disbelief.

Anyway, something keeps... My phone's messing up. Weird text. Hang on:

```
#include <iostr>  
int main() {
  std::cout << Existence is futile;
  return 0;
}
```

Oops, that's not supposed to be there. Just ignore it. Need to stop typing now. I’m gonna go stare at wall and think about what on earth I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥. Drinks?
